    <h1>Career</h1>
    <p class="center2">At the moment I don't have any idea about what career I would like to do. I'm willing to do a lot of different jobs but I haven't found one that grabs my attention. I still don't know what degree I want either. I'm considering:</p>
    <ul class="t">
      <li>Economics</li>
      <li>Marketing</li>
      <li>Graphic Design</li>
      <li>Psychology</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="clear">Hobbies</h2>
    <p class="center2">I tend to jump between activities rather than stay on one dedicated hobby but mainly I draw, play piano, or hike. I'm not professional level in drawing or piano but I'd like to say I'm decent. When I hike I tend to hike in Upper Park or on special occasions go to the coast and explore around with friends.</p>
    <h3 class="cleard">Music</h3>
    <p class="center2">I'm a simple man with simple tastes. Generally I like 90's rock, Electronic, and rap music. My favorite music artist is Kanye West. I understand most do not like him so I'm just going to leave it at that.</p>
